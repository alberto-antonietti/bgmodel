# BGs neurons model
This is a forked repo.  
We updated the original neuron models, synapses and poisson generators to be run in Pyhton3.8 and nest2.20.2.  

Run the following line to install the module.
```
./install-module-2.20.2.sh $NEST INSTALLATION PATH$
```

Applied in the [BGs network model](https://github.com/marcobiasizzo/BGs_nest).
